# Perforce Utilities

This program has 3 Modes: ExcelToCSV, PerforceUserCreator, and GroupUserDeleter. It is meant to take in an Excel Sheet with a list of names and emails, and generate a Perforce User with a specified Group, a Full Name, Username, Email, and Password, all of which will be output into another CSV that you can open in another Excel sheet, if necessary.

The GroupUserDeleter allows you to specify a Group and the software will go through each user in that group and delete them one by one.
